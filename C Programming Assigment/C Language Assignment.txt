slab 1... 0-2500: 0%
slab 2... 2500-5000: 10%
slab 3... 5000-10000: 20%
slab 4... 10000+: 30%
(for each range of a given income, the tax rate is different)
e.g. input: x = 5200
divisions are 0-2500, 2500-5000, 5000-5200
calculation:
0-2500 of x:
0% of 2500 = 0
2500-5000 of x:
10% of 2500 = 250
5000-1000 of x:
20% of 200 = 40
output: 290
