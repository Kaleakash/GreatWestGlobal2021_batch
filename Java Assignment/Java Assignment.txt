3. you have to declare four array variable id,name,salary, desg base upon the desg we have to provide the bonus for employee 
if desg is manger 5000, 
if desg is programmer 3000
else 1500
you have to take the help of scanner class to create the array memory and values. 

4. Create two classes Employee and EmployeeTest 
Employee class must be contains three instance variable ie id,name,salary
it must be contains three non static method ie read(), calSalary() and display() 
create Scanner class objet inside Employee to receive the value through keyword. 
EmployeeTest class contaisn main method 
create the object of Employee class call read method to receive the id, name and salary through keyboards. 
inside calSalary() method declare three local varible hra, da and pf. hra must be 10% on salary, da must be 5% on salary and pf is 
7% on salary. calculate grosssalary(but don't declare instance variable as grosssSalary variable).

6.
Create five classes Employee,Manager,Developer, Address and EmployeeTest 
Employee class must be contains three instance variable ie id,name,salary
it must be contains three non static method ie read(), calSalary() and display() 
create Scanner class objet inside Employee to receive the value through keyword. 
We have to create the Address class object inside Employee class(ie has a relationship (aggregation).
create Manager and Developer class and that class must be extends Employee class. 
inside manager we have to create extra variable ie numberOfEmp and two methods readMgr and disMgr to receive numberOfEmp
and display numberOfEmp; we have to call readAdd() method of address class to recive city, state and pincode. 
insider Developer we have to create extra variable ie projectName and two methods readDev and disDeve to receive 
projectName and dispay ProjectName; we have to call readAdd() method of address class to recive city, state and pincode. 
Now we have to create the Address class which contains city, state and picode instance variable and two methods 
ie readAdd() and disAdd(). Inside a address class we have to create the Scanner object. 

EmployeeTest class contains main method 
create the object of Programmer and Manager  class call read method to receive the id, name and salary through keyboards. 
inside calSalary() method declare three local varible hra, da and pf. hra must be 10% on salary, da must be 5% on salary and pf is 
7% on salary. calculate grosssalary(but don't declare instance variable as grosssSalary variable). 
then we call display method it must be display id,name,salary(ie gross salary values).
